Both of these techniques learn weights which act as word vector representations.\n\nCBOW tends to predict the probability of a word given a context. A context may be a single adjacent word or a group of surrounding words.

The output layer is a softmax layer which is used to sum the probabilities obtained in the output layer to 1. The weights learned by the model are then used as the word-vectors.\n\nWe will go ahead with the Skip-gram model as it has the following advantages:\n\n* It can capture two semantics for a single word. i.e it will have two vector representations of ‘apple’.

To classify a new object based on attributes, each tree gives a classification and we say the tree “votes” for that class. The forest chooses the classification having the most votes (over all the trees in the forest).\n\nIt works in the following manner. Each tree is planted & grown as follows:\n\n1. Assume number of cases in the training set is N. Then, sample of these N cases is taken at random but with replacement. This sample will be the training set for growing the tree.\n\n1. If there are M input variables, a number m (m<M) is specified such that at each node, m variables are selected at random out of the M. The best split on these m variables is used to split the node. The value of m is held constant while we grow the forest.\n\n1. Each tree is grown to the largest extent possible and there is no pruning.\n\n1.

Let’s quickly revisit what we have learned, initially we cleaned our raw text data, then we learned about 4 different types of feature-set that we can extract from any text data, and finally we used these feature-sets to build models for sentiment analysis. Below is a summary table showing F1 scores for different models and feature-sets.\n\n![imgur](https://i.imgur.com/3zmUSLN.png)\n\n\nWord2Vec features turned out to be most useful. Whereas **XGBoost with Word2Vec features** was the best model for this problem. This clearly shows the power of word embeddings in dealing with NLP problems.\n\n### WHAT ELSE CAN BE TRIED?\nWe have covered a lot in this Sentiment Analysis, but still there is plenty of room for other things to try out. Given below is a list of tasks that you can try with this data.\n\n1. We have built so many models, we can definitely try model ensembling. A simple ensemble of all the submission files (maximum voting) yielded an F1 score of **0.55**.\n\n1. Use Parts-of-Speech tagging to create new features.\n\n1. Use stemming and/or lemmatization. It might help in getting rid of unnecessary words.\n\n1. Use bi-grams or tri-grams (tokens of 2 or 3 words respectively) for Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF.\n\n1. We can give pretrained word-embeddings models a try."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
